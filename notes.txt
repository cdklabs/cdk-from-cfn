Testing
- Why are the source templates in the end-to-end tests in yml.
- java code gen looks so wierd .policyDocument(new GenericMap<String, JsonNode jsonNode = objectMapper.readTree(jsonString);>() 
- Descriptions are not being handled the same everywhere

What type of tests?

Where to source templates?

How to organize the test files? What constitutes a single test?
What should be broken up?
