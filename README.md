# cdk-from-cfn

In a world where people want to use the full extent of the cdk, there **was** no product that would transform all your
JSON/YAML into beautiful typescript...until now.

`cdk-from-cfn` will take your JSON/YAML and output the equivalent typescript.

## User Guide

```console
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/cdk-from-cfn [INPUT] [OUTPUT]
```

- `INPUT` is the input file path (STDIN by default).
- `OUTPUT` is the output file path; if not specified, output will be printed on your command line (STDOUT by default).

### Cargo Features

You can enable experimental languages (not enabled by default) by enabling the relevant feature:

```console

If you want to disable on-by-default languages, you can pass `--no-default-features`:
